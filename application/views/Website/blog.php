      <p class="text-justify mt-5">There is a large fan following of “Misal Pav” as a dish amongst many people across the world. Although it is originated from Nasik, Maharashtra, it is famously called as “Kolhapuri Misal” for a very strong reason. Misal Pav is a common dish across Maharashtra and it is been served differently under the same name. Many times the Misal pav recopies vary according to the restaurants and the taste of people around the area, which takes away the authenticity of the original taste. Many times they use Farsana, Pohe, Green peas, Mix vegetables etc in Misal Pav and if a true Misal consumer knows the real taste, would not actually like what he is having out there in restaurants. So for such people we have introduced an exclusive product that is easy to make and tastes authentic, just like actual Kolhapuri misal does.</p>
      <p class="text-justify font-weight-bold">Why buy Kolhapuri Mandai’s Kolhapuri Misal Package?</p>
      <p class="text-justify">“Kolhapuri Misal Package”, it is a fabulous blend of taste and high nutrition value, spicy and tasty at the same time. It contains authentic homemade Kolhapuri Kanda Lasun Chutney (Kolhapuri onion garlic chutney), Kolhapuri Sev-Chiwda, Matki to prepare Misal (Turkish gram) and Kolhapurimandai’s Misal Masala. All these ingredients lead towards preparing an authentic Kolhapuri Misal, and getting it from Kolhapuri Mandai is icing on the cake because, as we originate from Kolhapur, we understand the taste and the importance of homemade masalas (spices) and exactly what is needed.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">Kolhapuri Misal is just not a word, it is necessary to justify the real meaning of it, so what makes it different from the other misals?…. The answer is, it is a perfect blend of proper nutrition, because it consists of essential proportions of protein, fiber, carbohydrates and fats.</p>
