        <p>Where all do we deliver</p>
        <p>We deliver to all and any postal address around the world. However, Courier companies do not deliver to P.O.Box address, so we request you to provide full street address with pin code / zip code.</p>
        <p>Please note that residential shipments to USA & some other countries will be left at door if someone is not there to receive the package or no one answers the doorbell. Our courier agents DHL / FEDEX / TNT / UPS / Speed Post etc will not be able to provide sign confirmation of delivery made in such cases. To ensure that no disputes arise due to this, kindly make sure that someone is there to receive the package when courier delivery is attempted.</p>
        <p>No deliveries are made on Saturdays and Sundays in most countries with 5 day work culture. In many Islamic countries Fridays are normal off days. Some times we can try to organize deliveries on Saturdays also at some extra cost on case to case basis.</p>
        <p>Further deliveries are generally made during normal working hours of courier companies and these vary from country to country.</p>
        <p>Please note that there are no shipments made from the store on Sundays and public holidays as our logistics partners, do not make any pick-ups on those days.</p>
